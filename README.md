Was able to extract the name and image data and get it displayed just fine.

I ran into issues with getting the average price of each community. My thinking would be to compare the Id of the communites to the communityID of the homes and then extract the prices from there add them up and so forth.

I put both of those Id's into an empty array but ran into a road block on how to compare each id to one another.

I could hard code the id's in but that would be lazy
